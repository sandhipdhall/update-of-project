                    <p class="para4">“Before working with oLab, we did not have a brand or a marketing strategy. We worked with oLab to create a brand that speaks to our patients across various channels. In the first 14 months of our engagement, we have grown from five clinics to eight clinics. oLab’s strategic and technical partnership has been a significant help during this expansion period. It has been a great pleasure working with the oLab team, and we can happily recommend them to future clients.”</p>
